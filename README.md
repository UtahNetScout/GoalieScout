### Having Issues with Python Paths?

If you're seeing an error about the capital 'G' in "Goalie" when using paths in Python, check out our **[Path Fix Guide](PATH_FIX_GUIDE.md)** for solutions!

**Quick fix:** The error is caused by the backslash (`\G`), not the capital letter. Use one of these instead:
- Raw string: `r"Desktop\GoalieScout-copilot-check-past-projects"`
- Forward slashes: `"Desktop/GoalieScout-copilot-check-past-projects"`

Run `python path_examples.py` to see all the solutions in action!
